\section{Git Workflow}
\frame{\frametitle{Git Workflow}
  Decide what kind of a project you are working on. Is it something that
  people contribute small parts of sporadically, or is it something that
  requires collaboration between people working closely on a project?

  \bi
    \item A project where collaborators work closely together
      \bi
        \item Fork
        \item Merge other people's remote repositories using \gs
      \ei
    \item A project where people contribute small parts to a \emph{master}
      \bi
        \item Don't Fork
        \item Pull request on the \gh\ site
      \ei
  \ei

  We will focus on the first method, as we are mostly working on assessments
  or other smallish projects closely with collaborators.

\frame{\frametitle{Creating a new repository}
  \bi
    \item Sign into your \gh\ account, click on the
      \emph{Repositories} tab, and press the \emph{New} button.
    \item Give your repository a name. I like to use small letters and dashes
      between words.
    \item Check \emph{Initialize this repository with a README}.
    \item Leave \emph{Add .gitignore} and \emph{Add a license}
      set to \emph{None}.
    \item Click \emph{Create repository}.
  \ei
}

\frame{\frametitle{Cloning your new repository}
  \bi
    \item Once you have created a repository on \gh, copy the URL
      of the repository.
    \item Open the \gs\ and run the following command to clone your repository:
      \lstinline{git clone URL REPO-NAME}\\
      where:\\
      \bi
        \item URL is the url of your newly created repository. You can paste
          the URL into the command line (on Windows) by pressing the right
          mouse button.
        \item REPO-NAME will be the name of the directory to be created.
      \ei
  \ei
}

\frame{\frametitle{Windows only: Storing your credentials}
  When you push your changes to \gh, the \gs\ will ask you for your username
  and password every time. This is annoying, so issue the following command,
  and it will only ask you the first time. After that your credentials will be
  stored and you won't need to enter them again. You need to do this for each
  repository you have.\\
  \bigskip
  \lstinline{git config --global credential.helper wincred}
}

\begingroup
\small
\frame{\frametitle{Copy and commit \emph{.gitignore}}
  \bi
    \item Copy the \emph{.gitignore} file from the git-course directory and
      paste it into your newly cloned directory. You can edit this to suit
      the project, as there is a different \emph{.gitignore} file for each
      project.
    \item In the \gs, enter the new directory:\\
      \lstinline{cd REPO-NAME}\\
    \item Check the status of your repository:\\
      \lstinline{git s}
    \item You will see that the new file \emph{.gitignore} has not been
      added for commit. You need to add any new files to the commit by
      running the command:\\
      \lstinline{git add FILENAME}
    \item Make a commit for the changes:\\
      \lstinline{git com "Commit message"}\\
      where "Commit message" is a useful message saying what the commit
      contains.
    \item Push the commit to \gh:
      \lstinline{git push}
    \item Check the \gh\ webpage and see your commit and that the file
      has been uploaded.
  \ei
}
\endgroup

\frame{\frametitle{Add collaborators}
  If your repository is public, anyone can post an issue. If you want someone to
  be able to:
  \bigskip
  \bi
    \item Set assignees to issues
    \item Receive notifications when you reply to their issue
  \ei
  \bigskip
  You need to add them as a collaborator. Select the \emph{Settings} tab and then
  the \emph{Collaborators} button. Type their \gh\ username in and send them an
  invitation to collaborate.
