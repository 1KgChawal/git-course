To check changes that have been made (online at GitHub) via git comm, git push: go to Insights -> Graphs -> Network, there is a dot for every change and who it was made by.
Clicking on each dot will show the changes that have been made.
At the bottom you can add comments that will be sent to collaborators.

Use tab key in Git shell to automatically auto-fill options for code lines.
